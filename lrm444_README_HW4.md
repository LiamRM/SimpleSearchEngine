# Simple Search Engine
This is a simple search engine, matching queries to the best-fitting abstract out of a collection of 1400 research paper abstracts. This is the 4th assignment of my Natural Language Processing class. 

## ðŸš€ WHAT I LEARNED
- Information retrieval, extracting keywords from queries
- Parsing and cleaning input data
- Calculating term frequency (TF) and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores for a given set of documents
- Calculating cosine similarity scores between two vectors

### How to run the program
The program file ```hw4.py``` must be in the same directory as the two files ```cran.qry``` (which contains the collection of queries) and ```cran.all.1400```. 

To run the program, simply type: ```python hw4.py```.

A new file should be created called _output.txt_ which contains a ranked list of query-document matches.
